Python version should be at least 3.10

Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" (without quotes) to install all the dependencies before starting the executable.

#For Windows platform:-
Run CRM.exe to start the program.

#For Linux and MacOS platforms:-
Run CRM-TOOL to start the program


PS: I have developed and tested the program thoroughly on Linux and Windows systems. Currently, I am not wealthy enough to have
    a Mac at my disposal, so you might expect some bugs in the program for Macs. But I assure you to the best of my knowledge that the 
    odds of that happening are miniscule.


Thanks !!!
